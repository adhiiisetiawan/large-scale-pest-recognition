    Computes the sparse regularization loss for a given model and input images.

    The sparse regularization loss encourages the activations of the model to be sparse, promoting
    the selection of a subset of relevant features and reducing the overall complexity of the model.

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): The neural network model.
        images (torch.Tensor): The input images tensor of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width).

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The sparse regularization loss as a scalar tensor.
